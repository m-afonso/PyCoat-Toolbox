Procedure:

    1. Begin by weighing the cup when it is empty. (M0)
    2. Measure out 0.8-1.0g of the sample and place it into the cup. (M1)
    3. Place the crucible with the sample in an oven, at test conditions.
    5. Once the process is complete, remove the cup from the oven and allow it to cool in a desiccator.
    6. Finally, weigh the cup with the remaining residues to complete the procedure. (M2)

    NV% = ((M2 - M0) / M1) * 100
