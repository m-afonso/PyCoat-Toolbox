Procedure:

    1. Begin by weighing the crucible when it is empty. (M0)
    2. Measure out 3-5g of the sample and place it into the crucible. (M1)
    3. Place the crucible with the sample in an oven, either for 1h@120째C or for 3h@105째C.
    4. Transfer the crucible and its contents to an ashing furnace and heat for 2h@600째C.
    5. Once the process is complete, remove the crucible from the furnace and allow it to cool in a desiccator.
    6. Finally, weigh the crucible with the remaining residues to complete the procedure. (M2)

    Ashes% = ((M2 - M0) / M1) * 100
