 P/B and solids adjuster for eletrodeposition coat baths.


**Eletrodeposition coat baths** can be described as a mixture of **pigments**, **binder** and **solvents**.

They are usually comercialized as a bicomponent product. The first one, the **pasta**, is composed by water, pigments, binder and additives. The second one, the resin, is composed by binder, water and additives.


There are two important proprietors related to them which are important to control the application process:
- **NV**: non-volatile portion of the bath, the sum of pigments and binder.
- **P/B**: Pigment to binder ratio. The balance of pigments and binder control both corrosion protection and flexibility of the build film. When one increase, the other decreases.

The control of the values of NV and P/B are important while developing and testing the coat proprietors. Since the analysis to determine them take a long time to be run, it is important do make the most precise as possible adjustment do save time and avoid re-adjustments.
